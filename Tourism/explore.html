                <h3>Akple and Ayoyo Soup</h3>
                <p>
                    Akple is a smooth, soft dumpling made from corn dough, a staple of the Volta Region. Ayoyo is a green, slimy soup made from jute leaves (also known as Ewedu), often flavored with dawadawa (locust beans) and sometimes smoked fish. They are a classic pairing, with the mild akple complementing the flavorful ayoyo.

                <p>
                    A very popular dish across Ghana, Waakye is rice and beans cooked together with dried millet leaves (or sometimes other leaves) that give it a distinctive reddish-brown color and a unique flavor.

                <h3>Kenkey and Ppper with Fried Fish</h3>
                <p>
                    Kenkey is another fermented maize dough dumpling, but it has a firmer texture and a more pronounced sour taste than banku. It's traditionally wrapped in corn husks or plantain leaves and steamed. It's typically eaten with hot pepper sauce (often called "pepper" and can vary greatly in ingredients and spiciness), fried or grilled fish (like tilapia or mackerel), and sometimes boiled eggs or other accompaniments.

                <p>
                    Fufu is a starchy dough made by pounding boiled cassava and plantain (or yam, cocoyam, etc.) together until it reaches a smooth, elastic consistency. It's a very popular staple across southern and central Ghana. Light Soup (Abenkwan) is a flavorful, often tomato-based soup that can be made with various meats (like chicken, goat, or fish, including smoked fish) and vegetables. Fufu is typically swallowed in small balls with the soup.
