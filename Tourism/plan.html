                <h3>Cape Coast Castle</h3>
                <p>
                    Located in Cape Coast, this is one of about forty "slave castles" built on the Gold Coast by European traders.
Originally a Portuguese trading post established in 1555, it became a major shipping point for slaves during the transatlantic slave trade in the 18th century under British control.
After Ghana's independence, it was opened as a museum in 1974 and is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
Visitors can tour the slave dungeons, the governor's apartments, and see cannons and mortars used for defense.
The West African Historical Museum is located within the castle, housing artifacts related to the slave trade and Ghanaian culture.
It also marks the arrival of Christianity and the establishment of the first formal education system in the region.
Opening hours are 9:00 am to 4:30 pm daily.

                <h3>Lake Bosomtwe</h3>
                <p>
                    Ghana's only natural inland lake, located in the Ashanti region.
It was formed by a meteorite impact about a million years ago.
The lake is surrounded by steep, lush mountains and is considered sacred by Ashanti traditionalists.
Traditional beliefs hold that the spirits of the dead come to the lake to bid farewell to the god Twi.
There is a taboo against letting metal touch the water, so locals fish using wooden planks.
Activities include walking, bird watching, fishing, hiking, and canoeing.
An information center provides details about the lake and conservation efforts, and boat trips can be arranged.
Villages around the lake have had to relocate uphill over time due to rising water levels.
